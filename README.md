This code is for matching low quailty images to DSLR quailty.

Code borrows heavily from dped.

We difine new texture losses bassed on some No-Reference Image Quality Assessment algorithms, and a color loss based on Automatic Colorization task.

Full code will be released upon the acceptance of the paper.

For now, we replace them with a simpler but effeictive texture loss below and dped color loss
